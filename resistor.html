    <h3>What is a Resistor?</h3>
    <p>A resistor is an electronic component that resists the flow of electrons in a circuit. Almost all of the time when talking about resistors people mean fixed resistors that have a known static resistance. Static resistors are passive components i.e. they only consume power. In-circuit diagrams, resistors show up either as a rectangle following the international standard or as a squiggle which is the American version. In the rest of this article, we will refer to static resistors as just resistors.</p>

    <h3>How Does It Work and Application</h3>
    <p>A resistor limits the flow of current in three ways: using a less conductive material, making the material thinner, or making it longer. Many resistors are wire-wound, meaning a conductive wire is wrapped around an insulating core. Others, called carbon-film resistors, have a spiral of carbon instead of wire. Wire-wound resistors are more precise and stable, with resistance controlled by the number of turns and wire thickness. All resistors work based on these three principles, as they are the most reliable way to control resistance.</p>
    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>The Resistance was discovered by the year 1827 from Georg Simon Ohm, a German electrician. Ohm was born in Germany, in the city of Erlangen at 1787 and died at 1854. Georg Simon Ohm noticed that different materials that are considered as electrically conductive, will not allow the current to flow within their body with the same ease. The difficulty that each material had, had to do with some parameters such as the type of the material and some external factors such as the temperature or the humidity of the atmosphere. G.S.Ohm described this behavior and gave the name "Resistance". He then announced the Ohm's law that connects the resistance with the voltage and the current af follows:</p>
    <p>R =	V/I</p>
    <p>The resistor is measured with Ohms as a memorial to it's inventor.</p>
    <h3>Electronic Symbol And Notation</h3>
    <p>The basic unit of resistance is ohm (Ω). Most resistors have value marked on them. For surface mount resistors, this can be one of several options. They can be a 3 or 4-digit code representing the value using a value and multiplier system. For example, 102 would represent 10²or 1kΩ, the 4-digit type could be 1002 which is 100 x 10² or 10KΩ. For low values, you may see something like 4R7 which is 4.7Ω. R is used as a decimal point in this instance.</p>

    <h3>Types of Resistors</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Linear Resistors</b></li>
      <p>The resistors whose value changes with the applied temperature and voltage, are called linear resistors. Most types of resistors are linear devices that produce a voltage drop across themselves when a current flows through them There are two basic types of resistors with linear properties namely fixed resistors and variable resistors.</p>
      <li><b>Fixed resistors</b></li>
      <p>Fixed resistors are resistors with a specific value. Fixed resistors one of the most widely used types of resistor. Fixed resistors are used in electronics circuits to set the correct conditions in a circuit.</p>
      <p><b>Types of Fixed Resistors:</b></p>
      <ol>Wire Wound Resistors</ol>
      <ol>Thin Film Resistors</ol>
      <ol>Carbon Composition Resistors</ol>
      <br>
      <li><b>Variable Resistors</b></li>
      <p>Variable Resistors consist of a slider which taps onto the main resistor element and a fixed resistor element. Simply we can say that a variable resistor is a potentiometer with only 2 connecting wires instead of 3.</p>
      <p><b>Types of Variable Resistors:</b></p>
      <ol>Potentiometer</ol>
      <ol>Rheostat</ol>
      <ol>Trimmer Resistor</ol>
      <br>
      <li><b>Non-Linear Resistor</b></li>
      <p>Non-linear resistors are those types of resistors where the electric current flowing through it changes with the exchange in applied voltage or temperature and does not change according to Ohm’s law. There are several types of non-linear resistors, but the most commonly used are mentioned below.</p>
      <li><b>Thermistors</b></li>
      <p>Thermistors are a type of variable resistor that notices the change in temperature. In other words, it is a 2 terminal device that is very sensitive to temperature. The resistance of a thermistor is inversely proportional to the temperature.</p>
      <li><b>Varistor Resistors</b></li>
      <p>A varistor is a non-linear resistor made of semiconductor and current through which depends non-linearly on the applied voltage across it. MOV or metal oxide varistor is the most commonly used form of varistor resistors.</p>
      <li><b>Photo Resistor or LDR (Light Dependent Resistors)</b></li>
      <p>Photo Resistor or LDR (Light Dependent Resistors) or Photo Conductive Cell is a light-controlled variable resistor. The photo resistor resistance decreases with increase in incident light intensity.</p>
      <li><b>Surface Mount Resistors</b></li>
      <p>Surface Mount Resistors also called SMD resistor are rectangular in shape. An SMD is an electronic component that is made to use with SMT or Surface Mount Technology.</p>

    <h3>How to read the resistors' value with illustration</h3>
    <p>A Resistor is a passive two-terminal electrical component that restricts the flow of electrons or electric current passing through it to a certain level. Resistors are available in a range of different resistance values from one Ohm ( Ω ) to millions of Ohms. In most large power resistors, the resistance value and tolerance are printed onto the body of the resistor as numbers or letters. But in most small resistors with a power rating up to one watt, the resistance value and tolerance are often indicated with color bands. The number of color bands on a resistor varies from three to six.</p>
    <h3>Useful Steps</h3>
    <img src="https://static4.arrow.com/-/media/arrow/images/miscellaneous/1123-chart-how-to-read-resistor-color-codes-body-image.jpg" alt="Resistor Value Chart Image" class="color-band">
    <p>Here’s how you can use the color code to figure out the nominal value of a 3 or 4 band resistor:</p>
    <p>1. In most resistors the outer band is silver or gold, that band is probably the last band so the first band is at the other end. If there are no silver or gold bands on a resistor than compare both ends of the resistor, usually the first band is closest to a lead</p>
    <p>2. Read the color sequence of the resistor and search the color of the first band in the column labeled “1st digit” of the table given below. Similarly, search the color of the second band in the column labeled “2nd digit”. The first two bands always denote the first two digits of the resistance value in ohms.</p>
    <p>3. The number associated with the color of the third band is the multiplier. In the resistor shown in the figure, the third band is orange, so the multiplier is 103.</p>
    <p>4. Now read the color of the last band (4th band). The last band always shows the tolerance of the resistor. A silver band indicates that the actual resistance will be within 10 percent of the value indicated and the gold band indicates that the actual resistance will be within 5 percent. If you are using a three band resistor, then the default tolerance will be 20 percent</p>
