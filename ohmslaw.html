    <h3>Ohm's Law</h3>
    <p>Ohm's law says that the potential difference or voltage between two points is directly proportional to the current or electricity flowing through the resistance, and directly proportional to the circuit's resistance. Ohm's Law says that the current in a conductor is proportional to the voltage across the conductor. This is the case for most materials (such as metals) as long as the temperature (and other physical conditions) are kept constant.</p>

    <h3>Applications</h3>
    <p>When the other two values are known, Ohm's law can be applied in order to find the voltage, current, impedance, or resistance of a linear electric circuit.</p>
    <p>Key applications of Ohm's Law:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>It makes power calculations easier.</li>
      <li>Ohm's Law is used to maintain the desired voltage drop across electrical components.</li>
      <li>It is used to determine the voltage, resistance, or current in an electric circuit.</li>
      <li>Ohm's Law is also used to redirect current in DC ammeters and other DC shunts.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>History of Ohm's Law</h3>
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e6/Georg_Simon_Ohm_%281789-1854%29.jpg/800px-Georg_Simon_Ohm_%281789-1854%29.jpg" alt="Georg Simon Ohm" class="side-img">
    <p>Ohm's Law is the fundamental formula we use to investigate electrical circuits. It informs us that the potential difference between two points in an electrical circuit equals the current between two points and the sum of all electrical resistances of objects between the two points. The higher the potential difference of a battery (or its sum of electrical potential difference), the more current it will have. The lower the opposition, the larger the current.</p>
    <p>Georg Simon Ohm was born in Erlangen, Germany, in 1787 and entered that city's university in 1805, where he received a doctorate. He taught mathematics in schools in his area and conducted experiments in physics in a physics school laboratory, attempting to acquire a command of the principles of electromagnetism. He became professor of mathematics at Cologne's Jesuits' College in 1817.</p>
    <p>In 1826, he wrote articles providing a mathematical basis for the manner the circuits conducted heat in Fourier's work. In May 1827, Ohm wrote Die galvanische Kette, mathematisch bearbeitet, where the connection between electromotive force, current, and resistance was later expressed as Ohm's law. Ohm derived the experimental results from where he initially developed his law on 8 January 1826. However, the work received a muted welcome in its first publication, and he resigned Cologne's appointment, eventually accepting a new professorship in Nurenberg in 1833.</p>
    <p>Ohm's work would provoke further research into electricity during the next several decades. Ohm received the Royal Society's most prestigious award, the Copley Medal, in 1841. 'Ohm' was the electrical resistance unit in 1872.</p>
    <h3>Circuit Analysis</h3>
    <p>An electric circuit exists when a conductor path has been set up to allow for the continuous flow of electric charge. This movement of electric charge through conductors continuously in a circuit is a current, and is sometimes characterized in terms of "flow," like a fluid flowing through an open pipe.</p>
    <p>The drive behind charge carriers to "flow" around a circuit is called voltage. Voltage is a measurable amount of potential energy that is always relative from point to point.</p>
    <p>When we speak of a specific amount of voltage in a circuit, we're discussing the metering of an amount of available potential energy that's enough to make the charge carriers move from an arbitrary particular location in that circuit to some other such particular location. In the absence of the addition of two said particular locations, the word "voltage" doesn't make sense.</p>
    <p>Current flows through the conductors with some amount of friction, or resistance to movement. Resistance to movement is more accurately termed resistance. The current in a circuit is determined by the amount of voltage and the amount of resistance in the circuit to resist current flow.</p>
    <p>Similar to voltage, resistance is a comparative value between two points. Because of this, voltage and resistance values are often qualitatively noted as being "between" or "across" two points in a circuit.</p>
    <h3>Formula in Series Circuit:</h3>
    <p><strong>Rtotal = R1 + R2 + R3...Rn</strong> (The total equivalent resistance of a series circuit is equal to the sum of the individual resistances)</p>
    <p><strong>Itotal = I1 = I2 = I3...In</strong> (All components in a series circuit conduct the same current)</p>
    <p><strong>Vtotal = V1 + V2 + V3...Vn</strong> (The total voltage drop in a series circuit is equal to the sum of the individual voltage drops)</p>
    <p><strong>Ptotal = P1 + P2 + P3...Pn</strong> (The total power in a series circuit is equal to the SUM of the power dissipated by the individual resistors.)</p>
    <h3>Formula in Parallel Circuit</h3>
    <p><strong>Vtotal = V1 = V2 = V3...Vn</strong> (The voltage is the same for all components in a parallel circuit)</p>
    <p><strong>Itotal = I1 + I2 + I3...In</strong> (The total parallel circuit current is the sum of the individual branch currents)</p>
    <p><strong>Rtotal = 1/1÷R1+1÷R2+1÷R3</strong> (The total resistance of a parallel circuit is less than any of the individual brand resistances)</p>
    <p><strong>P = VI</strong></p>
    <p>You can also use these formula for solving power</p>
    <li>P = I²R</li>
    <li>P = V²/R</li>
